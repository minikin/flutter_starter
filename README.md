## ⛑ Tips & Tricks

- follow [Effective Dart](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart)
- consider to use `flutter beta channel` (It's quite stable and has latests updates and fixes)
- use `built_value`, `built_collection` and `built_value_generator`
- consider to use [streams](https://dart.dev/tutorials/language/streams) and [rxdart](https://pub.dev/packages/rxdart)
- consider to adopt [BLoC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLHln7wHgPE&t=1s) pattern
- if you have any nasty errors run `flutter clean` and delete `.dart_tool` folder (You may need to get your packages and regenerate your `build values`)
- use user snippets for visual studio code. [Like this ones]()
